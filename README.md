This project is a Professional Interactive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is used to structure the quiz screens such as the start screen, question screen, and result screen.

CSS is used for modern, responsive, and professional styling, including animations, progress bar, button effects, and layout design.

JavaScript is used to implement the quiz logic using a class-based approach, which manages questions, user answers, scoring, progress tracking, instant feedback, and quiz restart functionality.

The quiz dynamically loads questions, provides instant feedback for correct and incorrect answers, updates a progress bar, and displays the final score at the end. The application is fully interactive, user-friendly, and responsive across different screen sizes.
